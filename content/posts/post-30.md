I am providing my daily routine below to show what is feasible and to be completely transparent. I struggle with motivation from time to time, and learning / viewing others have structured schedules helps me in building mine. I hope this does not come off as 'braggy', that is the opposite of what I am trying to accomplish. I wish to inspire others into building a routine that fits their schedule and pushes them to be the best version of themselves.  This also serves as a source of accountability and motivation for myself, as I can track my progress and reflect over time.
Not described below is the time I spend with my Fiance and cat. I love spending as much time as I can with them. This is just describing, from a routine standpoint, what my day looks like.
