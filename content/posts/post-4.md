## FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)

FIRE, or Financial Independence, Retire Early, is a movement and lifestyle that emphasizes saving and investing a high percentage of one's income in order to become financially independent and able to retire early. The idea is that by saving and investing aggressively, individuals can reach a point where their investments generate enough income to cover their living expenses, allowing them to retire or pursue other goals without relying on traditional employment.

There are several strategies that individuals can use to achieve FIRE. One strategy is to focus on increasing income, such as through career advancement or starting a side business. Another strategy is to reduce expenses, such as by downsizing housing or cutting back on unnecessary expenses. A third strategy is to invest aggressively in a diversified portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and index funds. Additionally, some people focus on paying off high-interest debts, such as credit card debt, as a way to increase their overall savings rate.

Another strategy that is often mentioned in FIRE is to invest in index funds. Index funds are mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track a specific stock market index, such as the S&P 500, and are generally considered a low-cost way to invest. Another strategy is to invest in real estate, either by buying rental properties or through real estate investment trusts (REITs). Some people also use the "4% rule" as a guideline to help determine when they have reached financial independence. According to the rule, once you have saved 25 times your annual expenses, you can safely withdraw 4% of your savings each year to cover living expenses in retirement.
FAT FIRE, Lean FIRE, and Coast FIRE are all variations of the FIRE lifestyle, with different emphasis on spending and lifestyle choices.

FAT FIRE (Financial Independence, Absolute and Total FIRE) is the most aggressive version of FIRE and involves saving and investing a large percentage of one's income in order to achieve financial independence as soon as possible. This approach often involves living a minimalist lifestyle and cutting back on unnecessary expenses in order to maximize savings and investments.
Lean FIRE is similar to FAT FIRE, but with a slightly less aggressive approach. It still emphasizes saving and investing a high percentage of one's income, but also allows for some more moderate spending on lifestyle choices. The goal is to achieve financial independence and retire early, but also maintain a comfortable standard of living.

Coast FIRE is similar to Lean FIRE, but it's focus is on achieving financial independence and retire early, but not necessarily retiring completely. Instead, it aims to reduce the number of hours worked to a minimum level that would support a comfortable lifestyle.

Barista FIRE ( Financial Independence, Retire Early) is a variation of FIRE that allows for part-time work, often in a low-paying or low-stress job, to supplement income in retirement. This approach is also less aggressive and allows for more moderate spending on lifestyle choices while still working towards financial independence.
All these variations of FIRE share the same goal of achieving financial independence and retire early, but they differ in the level of aggressiveness and the lifestyle choices they allow.
