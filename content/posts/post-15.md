## Overview
Developers often find themselves coming up with meaningful commit messages to keep their version control accurate and informative. This helps in many ways: helping themselves by checking the commit history, helping other teammates identify changes and keeping the code properly identifiable and consistent. Commit messages are meant to describe code changes or references issues / bugs in which the new code includes the fix for. 

## Purpose
The purpose of CommitGPT is to handle the hard part for you. The 'hard part' of software engineering is documentation, commenting, and variable names. Everything else is easy. 
CommitGPT will analyze the changes you made via a git diff and propose / suggest commit messages. Oftentimes, this is better than what us as developers can come up with.

## How is this beneficial to me as a developer?
As a developer, I often find myself questioning previous code and commits either I wrote, or another developer wrote. What did this commit include? Was this bug included in this code change? The list goes on... 
Although Albeit slower than committing a message of 'test' or 'stupid bug fixed', I can provide more meaningful messages such as: "Bug Fix: Add null check across methods inside X Service"
