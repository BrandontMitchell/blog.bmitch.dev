Using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for personal project development offers a number of benefits. Firstly, VSCode is a highly customizable code editor that provides a wide range of features and tools to help you streamline your development process. This includes support for multiple programming languages, built-in Git integration, and an extensive library of extensions that can be used to add additional functionality.

Extensions in VSCode play a major role in increasing productivity and streamlining the development cycle. By installing the right extensions, you can add features that specifically cater to your development needs, making your workflow more efficient and effective. For example, you can use the Prettier extension to automatically format your code, or use the Git Graph extension to better visualize your Git repository. Additionally, extensions like Github Copilot and Github Pull Requests make it easier to work with Github, and Better Comments makes it easier to comment and document your code. The vast library of extensions available for VSCode provides endless possibilities for customization and streamlining your development process.
