I am providing my daily routine below to show what is feasible and to be completely transparent. I struggle with motivation from time to time, and learning / viewing others have structured schedules helps me in building mine. I hope this does not come off as 'braggy', that is the opposite of what I am trying to accomplish. I wish to inspire others into building a routine that fits their schedule and pushes them to be the best version of themselves.  This also serves as a source of accountability and motivation for myself, as I can track my progress and reflect over time.
Not described below is the time I spend with my Fiance and cat. I love spending as much time as I can with them. This is just describing, from a routine standpoint, what my day looks like.

# Personal Opinions

My naÃ¯ve view on life is that, given we only have 24 hours in a day, and I use 8 for work, 6-8 for sleep, I have about 8-10 hours to do whatever I want. Do I want to be lazy? Hell no! Laziness develops bad habits and suffering down the road. I prefer to suffer now while I am young and healthy (while allowing myself free time / f-off time) and enjoy the benefits later. 

# Morning

Mornings are quiet and are usually the best time for me to do my hardest / most thought-intensive tasks of the day. I wake up at 5AM, prep for the gym, take my vitamins, and then hit the gym. I try to arrive by 5:30AM. The main reason I am up so early is because I believe I have the most clear mind in the morning and the LA Fitness near me gets packed any other time, making it impossible to have a productive workout. Also, working out in the morning gives me more energy throughout the day and after a long day of work, I don't have to think about going to the gym anymore because it's already done. I get back around 6:45-7:00AM, shower (sometimes ice bath if its the weekend), and play maybe 1-2 games of chess. After I am all clean and got my chess fix in, I work on my side company, PNW Software Solutions. This lasts for maybe an hour to an hour and a half.
My 9-5 (more like 830-430)
I will begin work at around 830. Starting with checking my inbox (usually nothing crazy important), check what meetings I have for the day (usually not much), and start diving into my tasks. Sometimes I have to build a new AKS cluster, other times I am writing technical documentation for a design proposal. It widely varies -- but that's what makes it exciting (for the most part).

# Post-Work

After work I tend to debrief on tik tok / dumb time-wasting apps. Sometimes if I have the energy and there is a lot to be done, I will continue working on my side business, or have meetings with clients. I usually eat dinner relatively early, around 5pm, as I have found I sleep better the earlier I finish eating. I prepare my clothes for the next day (workout clothes), take my nightly vitamins, and try to read at the very minimum 1-2 chapters of whichever book I am reading. I am off to bed usually by 10:30PM.
