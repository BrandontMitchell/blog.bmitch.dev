## Overview
Tired of boring README.md files? Tired of writing on confluence (a site I despise wriiting docs on)? Want to have your docs integrated with real code examples, without navigating through multiple windows? Then Swimm is your answer! This tool is built for developers to transfer knowledge and outline documentation much faster and much cleaner. Integrate docs directly within repositories, import from existing readme's, and a ton more.
