## Overview
If you have interacted with a terminal before, you probably have thought of trying to view a file briefly. You may use a terminal file editor like VIM or nano, but if you don't want to go through the hassle of learning how to properly exit a file (*wink wink*), then you oftentimes type `cat filename.txt`. This will output the file in a readable format, for simple and quick viewing. 

Bat on the otherhand, has taken cat to the next level in terms of file interaction. It offers a range of features that benefit developers in many day-to-day tasks.
