Introduction
When you think of a 'leader', you might think of the President of the United States, John Snow from Game of Thrones, or someone else who displays importance and power in decision making. In software engineering, a leader is someone who is responsible for providing technical direction for a project or product, making critical decisions after researching, outlining, and walking through options, and ensuring the development process is smooth & efficient. They tend to be the personal leading the team from a technical standpoint, and can sometimes take the hit if products come out slower than stakeholders are anticipating. 
Although lower individual contributors (i.e. below Senior / Lead dev) do not contains some of these characteristics, they can provide value in alternative ways that highlight their importance and portrayal of being a leader.

Understanding the Role of an Individual Contributor in a Team Setting
An individual contributor is an employee who does not have any direct reports or management responsibilities. Instead, they focus on their own work and make contributions as a single member of a team. Individual contributors typically have specific skills, knowledge, or experience that they bring to the team, and they are responsible for executing on their specific tasks or assignments.
Individual contributors are often technical specialists, such as software developers, designers, engineers, or data scientists, who are highly skilled in their respective areas of expertise. They may also be subject matter experts, such as sales specialists or marketing professionals, who bring specific knowledge or experience to the table.
In contrast to managers or leaders, who have responsibility for managing and directing the work of others, individual contributors focus solely on their own work and deliverables. They are valued for their expertise, and their contributions are crucial to the success of the team and the organization.

Developing Leadership Skills

Communication Skills: Good communication is essential in any team setting, and it is especially important for an individual contributor who is viewed as a leader. This individual should be able to clearly and effectively communicate their ideas and thoughts to the team, as well as effectively listen and respond to the perspectives of others.

Additionally, having a deep understanding of the technical aspects of a project can help the individual contributor be a more effective leader and make informed decisions.
Interpersonal Skills: Interpersonal skills are key for building and maintaining positive relationships with team members. A leader who is able to effectively manage conflicts, negotiate compromises, and build strong relationships with team members will be able to create a positive and productive work environment.
