# Workout Types + Examples
Current program: Jeff Nippard's PPL 6x Program
This program is divided into two 8-week training blocks, each with unique and specialized priorities. Block 1 focuses primarily on mastering technical execution while building up a large work capacity through progressive load increases at a relatively high set volume. Block 2 begins with a deload week to emphasize recovery leading into the most psychologically and physically demanding phase of the program. The deload week sees a reduction in volume and intensity (effort) so that recovery can be optimized leading into the upcoming, more challenging phase. Block 2 focuses on increased effort by taking sets much closer to failure. Below is an example of one week in block 1: 

# Previous Programs + Ratings
_Andrew Jones' custom baseball-related athletic routine(s) - 10/10_

Off-season had different types of workout programs than during season. Off-season was focused on explosiveness, strength training, stability, etc. During season we reduced the frequency (as a team, I would go crazy without using the amazing gym CMC had) and focused on mobility, recovery, and maintaining strength to prevent injury.


_Jeff Nippard's Size & Strength Program - 8/10_ 

This was an upper / lower split 4x a week. It felt too crammed for each day, and contained a ton of days in which there were multiple heavy lifts (i.e. deadlifts + squats low reps higher weight). That is not my preferred training program, although I did gain a ton of strength from it.

_Jeff Nippard's Powerbuilding System - 3/10_

I joined a powerbuilding gym (not to compete, but because it was close and really nice). Of course as I was there I wanted to see if powerbuilding was for me -- it wasn't. An example day looked like: back squat, overhead press, glute ham raise, helms row and hammer curl. It never made sense to me and I didn't want to consume 5k calories and lift as heavy as I could, I didn't find enjoyment in that. I disliked it so much I decided to cut it short after 3 weeks.

_Jeff Nippard's PPL Hypertrophy Program (Current) - 10/10_

I love the split of this program, and the blocks allow for muscle recovery and muscle growth. I am in block 2 as I enter my cut, which is very helpful for me as it pushed my body further (cutting is easier if you have good workouts). 

_Layne Norton's PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) Program - 9/10_

This program contained both powerlifting and bodybuilding into one single program. I mentioned before I did not like powerlifting programs, however I do like the individual lifts (bench, squat, deadlift sometimes). This program balanced the demands of both to emphasize body sculpting and strength. 

# Diet / Supplements
There hasn't been a diet program I followed from an influencer, as I think its pretty simple to cut weight (harder as it goes on). Caloric deficit. 
To cut body fat, you need to create a caloric deficit, which means that you need to burn more calories than you consume. One way to do this is by manipulating your macronutrient intake, which refers to the amount of carbohydrates, protein, and fat that you eat. First, you need to determine your daily calorie needs, which depend on factors such as your age, sex, weight, and activity level. There are various online calculators that can help you estimate your calorie needs. Once you know your daily calorie needs, you can create a caloric deficit by eating less than that amount. A safe and sustainable deficit is around 250-500 calories per day. I am currently at around 1600 calories in the early stages of my cut. It will reduce to its minimum at around 1300 cals toward the end. In terms of macronutrients, a common approach is to increase your protein intake while decreasing your intake of carbohydrates and fats. This is because protein is more satiating than carbohydrates and fats, which can help you feel full and satisfied while eating less. In addition, Protein also helps with muscle retention while losing body fat. My current stats (goals) are:
> - Proteins (g): 210
> - Fats (g): 56.3
> - Carbs (g): 85
> - NET Calories: 1650

It's always recommended to consult with a Registered dietitian or a fitness professional, who can help you tailor your dietary and exercise plan to your specific needs and goals.
As for supplements, below is my current routine:
_Morning_
Vitamin D3 (250mcg / 10k IU) - Vitamin D3 helps in regulating the calcium and phosphorus levels in the body, which is important for bone health and immune system function.
Fish Oil (1200mg, 360 mg Omega-3) - Fish oil, containing omega-3 fatty acids, can help in maintaining heart health, lower inflammation and improve brain function.
High stim pre workout (high stim for now during cut, 330mg Caffeine) - Caffeine can help in improving physical and mental performance, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue.
_Night_
Magnesium (500mg) - Magnesium is important for various physiological processes like muscle and nerve function, protein synthesis, blood glucose control and blood pressure regulation.
