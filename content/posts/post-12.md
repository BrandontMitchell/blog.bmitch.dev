I saw script kit on a post from product hunt explaining this tool to automate various tasks. As a person who used to develop (and still does time-to-time) automation tools, I was intrigued. 



## Overview
Script Kit is an open-source kit to optimize developer workflows. In the main app, there are multiple examples of scripts to choose and/or gather ideas from. For example, searching for books using Open Library API directly from the app, or resizing an image to the desired size. There are a range of examples to get started on automating various tasks that a developer may use frequently.

## Usability
I have a PC (Windows) and a MacBook, so I wanted to see my experience with both. I saw they mainly support MacOS, but they did have an alpha version available for Windows. I am not sure what I did wrong but I simply could not run it on my windows machine. It downloaded fine, and showed a process running after clicking the app, however I never saw the screen / window I expected. On mac, it was very smooth in terms of download and opening. Navigation throughout the application was also very intuitive (coming from a technical background).

## Support
Given that the community scripts are filled with scripts created by the developer himself, it seems to be fairly early. Another piece of evidence that shows signs this is early is that the documentation still lives on github. This makes a lot of sense given it is open-source (I love that), but using something like gitbook gives it a better visual appeal for readers who may not be as technical. Here is an example of what the documentation looks like: Script Kit Documentation
