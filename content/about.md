I am currently a Software Engineer II at Starbucks. I have experience building scalable enterprise systems in .NET core, CI/CD experience in Azure DevOps & Jenkins, Cloud experience in Azure, and am a novice hacker. I have built a few companies, most recently working on consulting and technical integrations for home service companies.

This is my second brain. A place I can dump my thoughts and hopefully provide value to peers who take their time to read through it. Thank you for stopping by!
