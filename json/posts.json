Block 1 focuses primarily on mastering technical execution while building up a large work capacity through progressive load increases at a relatively high set volume. Block 2 begins with a deload week to emphasize recovery leading into the most psychologically and physically demanding phase of the program. The deload week sees a reduction in volume and intensity (effort) so that recovery can be optimized leading into the upcoming, more challenging phase. Block 2 focuses on increased effort by taking sets much closer to failure. Below is an example of one week in block 1: \n\n# Previous Programs + Ratings\n_Andrew Jones' custom baseball-related athletic routine(s) - 10/10_\n\nOff-season had different types of workout programs than during season. Off-season was focused on explosiveness, strength training, stability, etc. During season we reduced the frequency (as a team, I would go crazy without using the amazing gym CMC had) and focused on mobility, recovery, and maintaining strength to prevent injury.\n\n\n_Jeff Nippard's Size & Strength Program - 8/10_ \n\nThis was an upper / lower split 4x a week. It felt too crammed for each day, and contained a ton of days in which there were multiple heavy lifts (i.e. deadlifts + squats low reps higher weight). That is not my preferred training program, although I did gain a ton of strength from it.\n\n_Jeff Nippard's Powerbuilding System - 3/10_\n\nI joined a powerbuilding gym (not to compete, but because it was close and really nice). Of course as I was there I wanted to see if powerbuilding was for me -- it wasn't. An example day looked like: back squat, overhead press, glute ham raise, helms row and hammer curl. It never made sense to me and I didn't want to consume 5k calories and lift as heavy as I could, I didn't find enjoyment in that. I disliked it so much I decided to cut it short after 3 weeks.\n\n_Jeff Nippard's PPL Hypertrophy Program (Current) - 10/10_\n\nI love the split of this program, and the blocks allow for muscle recovery and muscle growth. I am in block 2 as I enter my cut, which is very helpful for me as it pushed my body further (cutting is easier if you have good workouts). \n\n_Layne Norton's PHAT (Power Hypertrophy Adaptive Training) Program - 9/10_\n\nThis program contained both powerlifting and bodybuilding into one single program. I mentioned before I did not like powerlifting programs, however I do like the individual lifts (bench, squat, deadlift sometimes). This program balanced the demands of both to emphasize body sculpting and strength. \n\n# Diet / Supplements\nThere hasn't been a diet program I followed from an influencer, as I think its pretty simple to cut weight (harder as it goes on). Caloric deficit. \nTo cut body fat, you need to create a caloric deficit, which means that you need to burn more calories than you consume. One way to do this is by manipulating your macronutrient intake, which refers to the amount of carbohydrates, protein, and fat that you eat. First, you need to determine your daily calorie needs, which depend on factors such as your age, sex, weight, and activity level. There are various online calculators that can help you estimate your calorie needs. Once you know your daily calorie needs, you can create a caloric deficit by eating less than that amount. A safe and sustainable deficit is around 250-500 calories per day. I am currently at around 1600 calories in the early stages of my cut. It will reduce to its minimum at around 1300 cals toward the end. In terms of macronutrients, a common approach is to increase your protein intake while decreasing your intake of carbohydrates and fats. This is because protein is more satiating than carbohydrates and fats, which can help you feel full and satisfied while eating less. In addition, Protein also helps with muscle retention while losing body fat. My current stats (goals) are:\n> - Proteins (g): 210\n> - Fats (g): 56.3\n> - Carbs (g): 85\n> - NET Calories: 1650\n\nIt's always recommended to consult with a Registered dietitian or a fitness professional, who can help you tailor your dietary and exercise plan to your specific needs and goals.\nAs for supplements, below is my current routine:\n_Morning_\nVitamin D3 (250mcg / 10k IU) - Vitamin D3 helps in regulating the calcium and phosphorus levels in the body, which is important for bone health and immune system function.\nFish Oil (1200mg, 360 mg Omega-3) - Fish oil, containing omega-3 fatty acids, can help in maintaining heart health, lower inflammation and improve brain function.\nHigh stim pre workout (high stim for now during cut, 330mg Caffeine) - Caffeine can help in improving physical and mental performance, increasing alertness and reducing fatigue.\n_Night_\nMagnesium (500mg) - Magnesium is important for various physiological processes like muscle and nerve function, protein synthesis, blood glucose control and blood pressure regulation.\n# 'Influencers' / Qualified trainers I follow:\n_Jeff Nippard_\n\nJeff Nippard is a Canadian bodybuilder, YouTuber, and fitness coach.

I struggle with motivation from time to time, and learning / viewing others have structured schedules helps me in building mine. I hope this does not come off as 'braggy', that is the opposite of what I am trying to accomplish. I wish to inspire others into building a routine that fits their schedule and pushes them to be the best version of themselves.  This also serves as a source of accountability and motivation for myself, as I can track my progress and reflect over time.\nNot described below is the time I spend with my Fiance and cat. I love spending as much time as I can with them. This is just describing, from a routine standpoint, what my day looks like.\n\n# Personal Opinions\n\nMy naïve view on life is that, given we only have 24 hours in a day, and I use 8 for work, 6-8 for sleep, I have about 8-10 hours to do whatever I want. Do I want to be lazy? Hell no! Laziness develops bad habits and suffering down the road. I prefer to suffer now while I am young and healthy (while allowing myself free time / f-off time) and enjoy the benefits later. \n\n# Morning\n\nMornings are quiet and are usually the best time for me to do my hardest / most thought-intensive tasks of the day. I wake up at 5AM, prep for the gym, take my vitamins, and then hit the gym. I try to arrive by 5:30AM. The main reason I am up so early is because I believe I have the most clear mind in the morning and the LA Fitness near me gets packed any other time, making it impossible to have a productive workout. Also, working out in the morning gives me more energy throughout the day and after a long day of work, I don't have to think about going to the gym anymore because it's already done. I get back around 6:45-7:00AM, shower (sometimes ice bath if its the weekend), and play maybe 1-2 games of chess. After I am all clean and got my chess fix in, I work on my side company, PNW Software Solutions. This lasts for maybe an hour to an hour and a half.\nMy 9-5 (more like 830-430)\nI will begin work at around 830. Starting with checking my inbox (usually nothing crazy important), check what meetings I have for the day (usually not much), and start diving into my tasks. Sometimes I have to build a new AKS cluster, other times I am writing technical documentation for a design proposal. It widely varies -- but that's what makes it exciting (for the most part).\n\n# Post-Work\n\nAfter work I tend to debrief on tik tok / dumb time-wasting apps. Sometimes if I have the energy and there is a lot to be done, I will continue working on my side business, or have meetings with clients. I usually eat dinner relatively early, around 5pm, as I have found I sleep better the earlier I finish eating. I prepare my clothes for the next day (workout clothes), take my nightly vitamins, and try to read at the very minimum 1-2 chapters of whichever book I am reading. I am off to bed usually by 10:30PM.\n\n# TLDR (Too long, didn't read)\n\n> - 5AM: Wakeup\n> - 5:30AM: Gym to workout\n> - 7:00AM: Work (side business), chess, f-off time\n> - 8:30AM - 4:30PM: Work (Starbucks)\n> - 4:30PM-7:00PM: Work (side business), hang with family, chess, dinner, f-off time\n> - 7:00PM - 10:30PM: Unwind, ice bath if necessary, stretch, read, prep for next day, bed.","slug":"post-2"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Budgeting 101","description":"I outline my budgeting strategies","date":"2023-03-08T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/01.jpg","categories":["finance","budgeting","personal"],"authors":["Brandon Mitchell"],"tags":["finance","budgeting","routine","determination"],"draft":false},"content":"\nBudgeting is important because it helps you manage your money and plan for your financial future. By creating a budget, you can keep track of your income and expenses, set financial goals, and make sure you have enough money to cover your bills and save for the things you want. It also allows you to identify areas where you may be overspending or areas where you can cut back. As a person starting out in their career, budgeting is especially important because it can help you establish good financial habits early on and set yourself up for success in the long-term.\n\nWhat are my short term goals?\nDetermine eligibility of Roth IRA Contributions (CPA necessary)\nMax 401k, HSA contributions\nHave $X in personal portfolio\nPayoff > 50% of car\n\nThese goals are ambitious, but with proper strategy can be executed properly.\n\nWhat are my long term goals?\nReach $5 million in investments (non-liquid counts, i.e. house, CDs, etc.)\nStart investment fund for kids as soon as they're born to plan for college payment (if they decide that is what they would like to do)\nBecome a part time subsitute teacher for fun\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n\nThe breakdown above gives me a savings rate (or investment rate) of around 55%.

The remaining is variable, which is not my favorite thing. I either save it if I haven't use my credit cards for much that period, or pay them off. \nBefore my net income is obtained, I match my employer's 5% 401k match, max my HSA for the month (3500 / 260 ~= 135), and have 0 claimed dependents so some money goes bye-bye to the government .\n","slug":"post-3"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Financial Goals","description":"I describe my plan for FIRE","date":"2023-03-08T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/01.jpg","categories":["finance","budgeting","personal"],"authors":["Brandon Mitchell"],"tags":["finance","budgeting","routine","fire","determination"],"draft":false},"content":"\n## FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early)\n\nFIRE, or Financial Independence, Retire Early, is a movement and lifestyle that emphasizes saving and investing a high percentage of one's income in order to become financially independent and able to retire early. The idea is that by saving and investing aggressively, individuals can reach a point where their investments generate enough income to cover their living expenses, allowing them to retire or pursue other goals without relying on traditional employment.\n\nThere are several strategies that individuals can use to achieve FIRE. One strategy is to focus on increasing income, such as through career advancement or starting a side business. Another strategy is to reduce expenses, such as by downsizing housing or cutting back on unnecessary expenses. A third strategy is to invest aggressively in a diversified portfolio of assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and index funds. Additionally, some people focus on paying off high-interest debts, such as credit card debt, as a way to increase their overall savings rate.\n\nAnother strategy that is often mentioned in FIRE is to invest in index funds. Index funds are mutual funds or exchange-traded funds that track a specific stock market index, such as the S&P 500, and are generally considered a low-cost way to invest. Another strategy is to invest in real estate, either by buying rental properties or through real estate investment trusts (REITs). Some people also use the \"4% rule\" as a guideline to help determine when they have reached financial independence. According to the rule, once you have saved 25 times your annual expenses, you can safely withdraw 4% of your savings each year to cover living expenses in retirement.\nFAT FIRE, Lean FIRE, and Coast FIRE are all variations of the FIRE lifestyle, with different emphasis on spending and lifestyle choices.\n\nFAT FIRE (Financial Independence, Absolute and Total FIRE) is the most aggressive version of FIRE and involves saving and investing a large percentage of one's income in order to achieve financial independence as soon as possible. This approach often involves living a minimalist lifestyle and cutting back on unnecessary expenses in order to maximize savings and investments.\nLean FIRE is similar to FAT FIRE, but with a slightly less aggressive approach. It still emphasizes saving and investing a high percentage of one's income, but also allows for some more moderate spending on lifestyle choices. The goal is to achieve financial independence and retire early, but also maintain a comfortable standard of living.\n\nCoast FIRE is similar to Lean FIRE, but it's focus is on achieving financial independence and retire early, but not necessarily retiring completely. Instead, it aims to reduce the number of hours worked to a minimum level that would support a comfortable lifestyle.\n\nBarista FIRE ( Financial Independence, Retire Early) is a variation of FIRE that allows for part-time work, often in a low-paying or low-stress job, to supplement income in retirement. This approach is also less aggressive and allows for more moderate spending on lifestyle choices while still working towards financial independence.\nAll these variations of FIRE share the same goal of achieving financial independence and retire early, but they differ in the level of aggressiveness and the lifestyle choices they allow.","slug":"post-4"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Being a Leader as an IC","description":"What is my personal leadership opinions while being an individual contributor?","date":"2023-03-08T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/01.jpg","categories":["career","leadership","personal"],"authors":["Brandon Mitchell"],"tags":["leader","work","career","opinion","determination"],"draft":false},"content":"Table of Contents\nIntro\nUnderstanding the role of an individual contributor in a team setting\nDeveloping leadership skills\nDemonstrating leadership qualities\nBuilding a network\nConclusion\n\nIntroduction\nWhen you think of a 'leader', you might think of the President of the United States, John Snow from Game of Thrones, or someone else who displays importance and power in decision making. In software engineering, a leader is someone who is responsible for providing technical direction for a project or product, making critical decisions after researching, outlining, and walking through options, and ensuring the development process is smooth & efficient. They tend to be the personal leading the team from a technical standpoint, and can sometimes take the hit if products come out slower than stakeholders are anticipating. \nAlthough lower individual contributors (i.e. below Senior / Lead dev) do not contains some of these characteristics, they can provide value in alternative ways that highlight their importance and portrayal of being a leader. Sometimes being a leader is realizing you have a set of interpersonal skills that higher developers fail to utilize or fail to have. Sometimes being a leader is consistently driving your team to its or the company's end goal. Sometimes it is introducing alternative ideas or considerations that were omitted originally. \n\nUnderstanding the Role of an Individual Contributor in a Team Setting\nAn individual contributor is an employee who does not have any direct reports or management responsibilities. Instead, they focus on their own work and make contributions as a single member of a team. Individual contributors typically have specific skills, knowledge, or experience that they bring to the team, and they are responsible for executing on their specific tasks or assignments.\nIndividual contributors are often technical specialists, such as software developers, designers, engineers, or data scientists, who are highly skilled in their respective areas of expertise. They may also be subject matter experts, such as sales specialists or marketing professionals, who bring specific knowledge or experience to the table.\nIn contrast to managers or leaders, who have responsibility for managing and directing the work of others, individual contributors focus solely on their own work and deliverables. They are valued for their expertise, and their contributions are crucial to the success of the team and the organization.\n\nDeveloping Leadership Skills\nAs an individual contributor who is a leader of a team, even without a formal leadership title, it is essential to develop and maintain strong communication, technical, and interpersonal skills.\nCommunication Skills: Good communication is essential in any team setting, and it is especially important for an individual contributor who is viewed as a leader. This individual should be able to clearly and effectively communicate their ideas and thoughts to the team, as well as effectively listen and respond to the perspectives of others. They should also be able to effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\nTechnical Skills: As a technical expert and individual contributor, maintaining and developing technical skills is crucial. This will help them stay current with the latest industry trends and technologies, and it will also enable them to provide valuable contributions to the team. Additionally, having a deep understanding of the technical aspects of a project can help the individual contributor be a more effective leader and make informed decisions.\nInterpersonal Skills: Interpersonal skills are key for building and maintaining positive relationships with team members. A leader who is able to effectively manage conflicts, negotiate compromises, and build strong relationships with team members will be able to create a positive and productive work environment. They should also be able to effectively motivate and inspire team members, and provide constructive feedback to help team members grow and develop.\nOverall, the value of developing and maintaining these skills lies in their ability to help the individual contributor be a more effective leader and team member. By demonstrating strong communication, technical, and interpersonal skills, they can help drive the success of the team and contribute to the organization's goals.\nDemonstrating Leadership Qualities\nTaking Initiative: To demonstrate initiative, look for opportunities to contribute to the team or organization beyond your normal job responsibilities. Identify areas where improvements can be made and propose solutions. Be proactive in seeking out new projects or tasks and volunteer for assignments that will challenge you and help you grow.\nBeing Accountable: To show accountability, take ownership of your work and deliverables. Set high standards for yourself and hold yourself to those standards. If you make a mistake, take responsibility for it and take the necessary steps to rectify the situation. Be transparent about your progress and communicate any potential issues to your team or supervisor in a timely manner.\nEmbracing Change: To demonstrate a willingness to embrace change, be open-minded and flexible. Be willing to learn new skills and technologies, and adapt to new processes and procedures as needed. Show a positive attitude towards change and be a role model for others by embracing new challenges and opportunities. Be willing to challenge the status quo and offer innovative ideas to drive change and improvement.\nBy consistently demonstrating these leadership qualities, you can establish yourself as a valuable member of the team and someone who is committed to driving success for the organization. Over time, you may also be recognized for your contributions and be given additional leadership opportunities within the company.\nBuilding a Network\nBuilding a network of relationships, both within and outside of your organization, can benefit you as an individual contributor and help you stand out as a leader in several ways:\nProfessional Development: Building a network of relationships can provide opportunities for professional development. You can connect with people who have expertise in areas that interest you and learn from them, which can help you expand your skills and knowledge. You can also seek out mentors who can provide guidance and support as you grow in your career.\nCareer Advancement: Having a strong network can also open up opportunities for career advancement. By establishing relationships with decision-makers and influencers within your organization, you can increase your visibility and be better positioned for promotions and other opportunities for growth. Additionally, by building relationships with people in different departments or functions, you can gain a broader perspective of the organization and understand how your role fits into the bigger picture.\nProblem Solving: Building a network can also help you solve problems and make decisions more effectively. You can reach out to your network for advice or recommendations, and they may be able to offer valuable insights or perspectives that you wouldn't have otherwise considered.\nStaying Current: Building a network of relationships can also help you stay current with industry trends and developments. You can connect with people in your field who are knowledgeable about the latest advancements and technologies, and learn from them to stay ahead of the curve.\nIn conclusion, establishing a network of relationships can bring a multitude of benefits to you as an individual contributor. From enhancing your professional development and career advancement opportunities to providing solutions for challenges and keeping you updated with the latest industry trends. By forming connections and building relationships, you can showcase your leadership abilities, broaden your impact, and set yourself up for success.\nConclusion\nA leader in software engineering is someone who provides technical direction, makes critical decisions, and ensures a smooth development process. Individual contributors are valued for their expertise, and they can also demonstrate leadership qualities such as taking initiative, being accountable, embracing change, and building a network. It is essential for individual contributors to develop strong communication, technical, and interpersonal skills to be effective leaders.\nBeing an effective leader as an individual contributor is about more than just having technical expertise. By demonstrating strong communication, technical, and interpersonal skills and consistently exhibiting leadership qualities, such as taking initiative, embracing change, and building a network, individual contributors can establish themselves as valuable members of their team and position themselves for career advancement.\nIf you are an individual contributor looking to demonstrate your leadership potential, focus on developing and maintaining strong communication, technical, and interpersonal skills. Take the initiative to look for opportunities to contribute beyond your job responsibilities and embrace change. Building a network of relationships can also be a valuable way to increase your visibility, learn new skills, and position yourself for career advancement. Remember, being a leader is not just about holding a formal leadership title, it's about being a positive influence on those around you and making a meaningful impact on your team and organization.","slug":"post-5"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"What I've learned from creating software companies","description":"I have created various companies throughout the past few years, and here is my advice.","date":"2023-03-06T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/01.jpg","categories":["career","tech","business"],"authors":["Brandon"],"tags":["career","ceo","tech","software","determination"],"draft":false},"content":"*Preface*: I am only 24. I usually hear good startups are founded by folks when they're in their 30s or 40s, as they have had a range of experiences (both successful and unsuccessful). I have created a few different companies focused on software -- whether that be a product or a service. I am still young and I am still heavily inclined to continue learning, but I do hope my young-minded thoughts and concepts can unlock the barrier of entry for other folks. Keep in mind all of these are technically side businesses, as I've either had a full time job or attending university.\n\n## Intro\nI have created 3 companies within the last 3-4 years (2 formal LLCs, 1 individual freelance work which I consider to be somewhat of a company). My first company was called Strike Robotics, which was an automated checkout app (desktop) to help users checkout highly sought after items. At our peak, we reached > hundreds of thousands of items purchased through our system, generating close to 100k in profit for our users. For those that don't know, I am talking peak COVID-19, when resellers were overpricing all things they could get their hands on - PS5s, Yeezys, Jordans, home gyms, etc. We supported over 30 sites (walmart, footlocker, yeezysupply, amazon, etc) to automate the monitoring / checkout process in under a few seconds. We were not the only ones doing this, many other folks ran similar companies, which lead to a constant battle between who had the most consistent and fasted bot, as well as others having insane bypasses to allow them to take all stock for a given release. This was a fun time. We onboarded a wizard developer who was amazing, allow a bit pricey. As the market tanked for resell-able items, so did our user base. Losing users = losing profit. We went through a phase where I was not paid for my work (I am talking about 10-30 hours of my time per week) for about 6 months. In fact, because all of the bypasses and third-party services we needed to buy, I didn't really make much at all. Because we supported so many sites, we had constant battles with updated security and trying to improve our speeds of our tasks. Updated security from a site could range from an additional cookie generated before checkout to a whole new anti-bot system -- both not very quick to find solutions for. So I had no pay, continual security updates, and complaining users, which eventually lead to the (mutual, I had an amazing co-founder) dissolvement of our company. \n\nAs of 2022, I have established a limited liability company for software consulting, focused on the home services industry. Despite still being in the early stages of development, I am confident in the potential impact this company can have on our clients, and am fully committed to its success. Currently, we have only one client, but they have been a valuable asset to our growth and development. Their business is well-established in the home services industry, but they were utilizing a multitude of services for various tasks, such as invoicing, accounting, time tracking, and inventory management. Recognizing this, we decided to create an all-in-one tool for them, streamlining their processes and eliminating the need for multiple services. Our goal is to continue seeking out similar clients or introducing new technologies to existing clients, with the aim of automating their processes and increasing efficiency.\n\n## Learning #1: The importance of having a clear vision\nHaving a clear vision is important for creators of small businesses within technology because it helps to define the direction and purpose of the company, and serves as a guide for decision-making and goal-setting. A clear vision allows entrepreneurs to stay focused on their ultimate goal, even when faced with obstacles or challenges. It also helps to communicate the company's mission and values to employees, investors, and customers, which can increase buy-in and support. The instability of my first company lead to the eventual failure of it. My second company has learned without a vision, we have nothing to develop for. \nAdditionally, having a clear vision can also help to attract and retain top talent, as it provides employees with a sense of purpose and direction, and allows them to understand how their work fits into the larger picture. It also helps to identify potential opportunities for growth and expansion, and can inform the development of new products or services.\n\n## Learning #2: The importance of choosing the right people\nChoosing the right people is important for creators within technology because a strong team is essential for the success of a small business. The right team members can bring a wide range of skills, experiences, and perspectives to the table, which can help to drive innovation, improve efficiency, and increase productivity. My first company, I had a 16 year old co-founder. Dude was amazing. He had never really programmed before, but his drive to make an amazing product motivated me to continue working with him. Our dev-hire was also amazing, and very motivated. His background was heavily in CS and he simplified so much of our processes, establishing good code standards and making it much easier to build on top of. My second company also has amazing co-founders. My friend who develops with me does not have a background in CS either, yet he continually grinds to ensure things are done and done well. \nHaving the right people in place can also help to foster a positive and supportive work culture, which can improve employee morale and retention. Additionally, having a team with diverse backgrounds and experiences can also help to better understand and serve the needs of a diverse customer base.\n\n## Learning #3: The importance of learning how to pivot\nIn the world of technology, the pace of change is extremely fast, and new technologies and trends can quickly disrupt traditional business models. Being able to pivot and adapt to these changes is crucial for small businesses to remain competitive and stay relevant in the market. Whether it be the tech stack you are using becomes outdated, or your customer prioritizes something else, it is crucial to respond accordingly and thoughtfully. Sometimes the customer doesn't see the vision of the developers, sometimes its the other way around, and it is critical that you learn how to handle both scenarios.\n\n## Learning #4: The importance of putting the customer first\nLearning to put the customer first is important for creators of small businesses within technology because it helps to ensure that the products or services they are offering are meeting the needs and wants of their target market. By putting the customer first, small business owners can develop a deep understanding of their customers' pain points and challenges, and design solutions that address those needs. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and loyalty, which can be crucial for the long-term success of a small business.\nPutting the customer first can also help small business owners to identify new opportunities for growth and expansion. By listening to customer feedback and understanding their needs, small business owners can identify new products or services that could be developed or new markets that could be entered.\n\n## Learning #5: The importance of staying persistent\nThere will be obstacles and setbacks while creating and building a company, and it's important to have the perseverance to overcome them. Persistence allows small business owners to stay focused on their goals and not give up when faced with challenges. This can be particularly important in the technology industry, where new products and services are constantly being developed and competition is fierce. Competition often does one of two things -- it makes you stronger, or it destroys you. Learning how to stay persistent can build strength in your company. That being said, it is not always easy.\nAs I've learned from my first company, the more persistent you are, the happier your customers are and the more you are able to bring in (usually word of mouth). Also, if you product isn't behaving as expected but customers see your dedication, they establish trust and are more willing to continue to support as they anticipate beneficial updates. \n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, as a young entrepreneur in the technology industry, I have learned valuable lessons through my experiences creating small software companies. The importance of having a clear vision, learning to adapt and pivot, choosing the right people, putting the customer first, and being persistent have all been crucial in my journey. These lessons have allowed me to stay focused on my goals, understand and serve the needs of my customers, and build a strong and dedicated team. I hope that my young-minded thoughts and concepts can inspire other young entrepreneurs to take the leap and pursue their own business ventures. It's not easy, but it's definitely worth it. It's important to have a clear vision and know what you want to achieve, be open to change and adaptability, have a strong team, stay persistent even in the face of obstacles and challenges and always put the customer first. These are the lessons that I've learned so far and I will continue learning as I move forward. I will keep working on my current company and I'm looking forward to see where it takes me.","slug":"post-6"},{"frontmatter":{"title":"Code Katas # 1","description":"An intro to Code Katas and my first one.","date":"2023-03-13T05:00:00.000Z","image":"/images/posts/01.jpg","categories":["career","tech","code","codekata"],"authors":["Brandon"],"tags":["career","ceo","tech","software","determination"],"draft":false},"content":"http://codekata.com/kata/kata01-supermarket-pricing/\n\n## Overview\nThis example is more of a thought exercise. I will not be coding a solution (or solutions) to this example, but more outline various thought processes I may have while doing one. A simple thought experiment for supermarket pricing:\nSome items have standard prices (i.e. banana for $0.25, bag of chips for $1.25)\nSome items have higher tax (i.e. alcohol tax)\nSome items can be bundled for lower value (3 for $5)\nSome items can be bundled for free item (buy 2 get 1 free)\nThe Goal: Implement 1 solution (or more) that could encapsulate all scenarios and special pricing(s) of a supermarket.\n### Thinkers: \n- Does fractional money exist?\n- When does rounding take place?\n- How do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions, is this necessary?\n- Are costs and prices the same class of 'thing'?\n- How do you handle stock for items included in buy X get Y free?\n\n### Brain Dump\nThis holds my initial thought process during my first run at this Kata. I have worked with inventory systems and pricing strategies before thanks to my job(s), so I am hoping I can leverage that previous knowledge to explain solutions to this problem.\nLet's dumb it down for a bit: assume everything costs $1 and there are no discounts. We know we will have the standard scenario where the customer walks into the store, grabs items, brings them to the register and the store clerk will ring each item up totaling to $1 * X items. No extra calculation is necessary in this example. This helps us build a flow of the initial & over-simplified scenario.\n\nNow, let's think about what a product looks like, in terms of a DB table:\n\n`Product`\n- id: int\n- sku: nvarchar\n- name: nvarchar\n- (FK) pricing_strategy_id: int\n- (FK) location_id: int\n\nWe have its id, sku, name, and a location reference. We purposefully avoid including the price directly in this object because we now are considering the various pricing scenarios to implement. Let's look at what the pricing strategy table looks like and I will discuss my thoughts below.\n\n`PricingStrategy`\n- id: int\n- default_price: int\n- discount_percentage: int\n- min_qualifier: int\n- max_qualifier: int\n\nLet's break this down:\ndefault_price: what is the price at its base if there were no discounts?\ndiscount_percentage: what discount do we include? if its buy 2 get one free, that means we can set the discount percentage to 333\nmin_qualifier: what is the minimum amount of items to implement the discount_percentage?\nmax_qualifier: what is the maximum amount of items to implement the discount_percentage?\n\n### The flow\nNow that we have defined the basic set of tables, we can discuss at a high level what the flow would look like:\nCustomer walks in, grabs 3 canned beans (buy 2 get 1 free, $2.50 each), 2 bananas (regular pricing, $1 each), 3 bags of potatoes (buy 3 for $5.00, originally $2.00 each). \nCustomer goes to checkout and clerk begins to ring up customer.\nThe total at the register before calculation is (2.5 * 3) + (2 * 1) + (3 * 2) = $15.50\nThe register begins looking up pricing strategies and applying the discounts where necessary:\nFor the beans:\ndefault_price: 250 (int to avoid float rounding error, divide and round at the end of checkout)\ndiscount_percentage: 333 (buy 2 get 1 free = 3 quantity set to 2/3 price = 1/3 discount)\nmin_qualifier: 2\nmax_qualifier: 2\nFor the bananas:\ndefault_price: 100\ndiscount_percentage: 0\nmin_qualifier: MAXINT\nmax_qualifier: MAXINT\nFor the bags of potatoes:\ndefault_price: 200\ndiscount_percentage: 5/6 total so 1/6 discount ~= 167\nmin_qualifier: 3\nmax_qualifier: 3\n\nTotal is evaluated:\nBeans: 2.50 * 3 -> (2.50 * .66) * 3) ~= 4.97\nBananas: 2 * 1 -> (no discount) = 2.00\nPotatoes: 3 * 2 -> (3 * (2 * 0.833)) ~= 4.998\n\nThis initial solution seems to work okay for various pricing strategies. It is up to the business logic to handle the pricing strategy implementation however it seems fairly novel at a glance. I will continue to reflect on this Kata as the week goes, but this was a fun example of how to think of solutions on random problems.

These vulnerabilities can have serious consequences, including financial losses, damage to a company's reputation, and legal liabilities. It is therefore essential for businesses and organizations to take steps to prevent web application vulnerabilities.\nThere will always be an ongoing battle between attackers and users / companies with web apps. Attackers arguably have the upper hand in this battle, as the reward is deemed more valuable in there eyes. Attackers are often hired by companies to test their systems, offered bounties in the case they find an exploit, or sometimes they are not interested in payment, but user information or data dumps. \n\n## Examples of Common Web App Vulnerabilities\nI will not be able to cover all the web app vulnerabilities in this section, but I will describe some very common examples of what could be considered a vulnerability in a web app. \n### SQL Injection: \nThis occurs when an attacker is able to insert malicious code into a web application's database through a vulnerable input field. This can allow the attacker to access sensitive information or make unauthorized changes to the database.\nRetrieving hidden data: modifying a SQL query to obtain or return additional results.\n\nLet's imagine we have a website https://example-website.com/products?type=clothes. This is the url we see when we visit the product page and sort by clothes.  An attacker's mind wonders what data source this query targets. We can assume this may utilize SQL, which would lead to a query such as:\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE type = 'clothes' AND isActive = 1\n```\n\nAssuming our thought process is correct, we can modify the query to display more / different information:\n\n```\nhttps://example-website.com/products?type=clothes'--\nWhich translates to:\nSELECT * FROM products WHERE type = 'clothes'-- AND isActive = 1\n```\n\nThis result will now return all products even if some have been deactivated. This is just an example of how you can retrieve hidden information, meaning it could apply to other tables in storage (assuming limited user input validation, etc. ). \n\n### Subverting application logic: \nSimilar to the hidden data sql injection, we can subvert the logic to return sensitive data. Imagine you log in with user / pass, which results in a query to validate the credentials match for that user. We can assume there is a master account or admin account, and attempt to retrieve those credentials.\nRetrieving data from other tables: An attacker can leverage a range of additional SQL commands such as Unions, to execute addition SELECT queries and append those results to the original query. \nExamining the database: It is sometimes useful for an attacker to understand the database itself, which can sometimes unlock additional vulnerabilities in the event the version has known exploits, etc. \nSELECT * FROM information_schema.tables is a commmon query which will display which tables exist in the database.\nHow to detect SQL Injection Vulnerabilities\nUtilizing a tool such as Burp Suite's https://portswigger.net/burp/vulnerability-scanner\nTesting entry points of an app (input fields, query parameters)\nSubmitting the single quote character ' and looking for errors or other anomalies.\nSubmitting some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and looking for systematic differences in the resulting application responses.\nSubmitting Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and looking for differences in the application's responses.\nSubmitting payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within an SQL query, and looking for differences in the time taken to respond.\nSubmitting OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within an SQL query, and monitoring for any resulting interactions.\n\n\n*Cross-site scripting (XSS)* : This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into a web application, which is then executed by other users when they visit the site. This can be used to steal sensitive information or perform other malicious actions.\n\n*Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)* : This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to trick a user into making an unintended request to a web application, such as changing their password or transferring funds.\n\n## How to Secure Web Applications\nInput validation: It is important to validate user input to ensure that it is in the correct format and does not contain any malicious code.\nEscaping user input: When displaying user input on a web page, it is essential to properly escape any special characters to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.\nProper error handling: Properly handling and logging errors can help to prevent attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities in a web application.\nUsing secure frameworks and libraries: Using secure frameworks and libraries can help to prevent vulnerabilities by providing secure functions and tools for common tasks.\nEnsuring secure communication: Using secure protocols such as HTTPS can help to prevent attackers from intercepting sensitive information during communication between a web application and a user.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn summary, web application vulnerabilities can have serious consequences for businesses and organizations. By following secure coding practices, developers can help to prevent these vulnerabilities and protect sensitive data and systems. It is important for developers to stay up-to-date on best practices and continue to educate themselves on web application security.\n\n\n\n### References\nhttps://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection\n","slug":"post-8"}]
